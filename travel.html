        <h1>Travel to Prague</h1>
        <h3 class="Attractions">Top-Rated Tourist Attractions in Prague</h3>
        <p id="about-attractions">Prague has been nicknamed the <em>"city of a thousand spires"</em> for good reason: as you glance over its 1,100-year-old skyline, you'll be rewarded with splendid views of lovely domed churches and soaring old towers that combine to make Prague one of the world's architectural gems. Everywhere you look, fine examples of Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance, and Art Nouveau styles dot the city, providing a dramatic contrast to the sturdy old Prague Castle.</p>
        <p id="about-attractions">Possessing one of the best-preserved historic city centers in Europe, the narrow laneways of Prague's delightful<strong> Old Town</strong> open up onto spectacular squares, each home to well-preserved historical buildings just waiting to be explored. Must-sees include the famous <strong>Charles Bridge </strong>over the Vltava River, the splendid <strong>Jewish Quarter</strong> with its old synagogues, and, of course, the city's many historic churches.</p>
       <p id="best-places"> Discover the best places to visit in this enchanting city with our list of the top attractions in Prague.</p>
       <ol>
           <li><strong class="prague">Prague Castle</strong></li>
           <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Charles_Bridge_%28Karl%C5%AFv_most%29%2C_Vltava_River%2C_Prague%2C_2015.jpg"width="420" height="280">
           <p id="about-attractions">Located in Prague's Hradcany neighborhood, Prague Castle (Pražský hrad), once the home of Bohemia's kings, is today the official residence of the Czech Republic's President and one of the city's most visited tourist attractions. Originally built as a walled fortress around AD 870, the castle has changed dramatically over the years and contains examples of most of the leading architectural styles of the last millennium. Within the castle walls are a number of Prague's most popular tourist sites, including <strong>St. Vitus Cathedral, St. George's Basilica,</strong> the <strong>Powder Tower</strong>, the <strong>Old Royal Palace</strong>, and the <strong>Golden Lane</strong>.</p>
           <p id="about-attractions"><strong>The largest castle complex in the world</strong>, this vast fortress requires considerable time to tour, but it's time well spent (particularly rewarding are the excellent views over the Vltava River with the old town and its many beautiful spires in the background). Highlights include the Old Royal Palace's main hall, the Vladislav Hall, so large it could be used for jousting tournaments, and staircases wide enough to allow mounted knights to use them. Be sure to also spend time in the <strong>Royal Garden</strong>, dating back to 1534 and home to a number of superb old buildings, including the Ball Game Pavilion, the Royal Summer House with its Singing Fountain, and the Lion's Court.</p>
           
           <p id="about-attractions">The best way to fully explore the castle is on a <strong> Prague Castle Walking Tour</strong>. Also check the castle's official website for news and updates regarding cultural events, such as classical music concerts, lectures, and workshops.</p>
           <p id="about-attractions">One of the top things to do at <strong> night in Prague</strong> is to find a good spot from which to enjoy the castle illuminations that light this magnificent structure in a range of hues. In fact, basing yourself in a hotel in the vicinity of Prague Castle is a good idea, so you can experience the city highlights by day and night.</p>
           <li><strong class="prague">Charles Bridge</strong></li>
           <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Karl%C5%AFv_most.jpg" alt="The Charles Bridge" width="420" height="280" >
           <p id="about-attractions">One of the most recognizable old bridges in Europe, magnificent Charles Bridge <strong>(Karluv Most) </strong>boasts 32 unique points of interest along its 621-meter span. Built in 1357, the bridge has long been the subject of a great deal of superstition, including the builders having laid the initial bridge stone on the 9th of July at exactly 5:31am, a precise set of numbers (135797531) believed to give the structure additional strength. For added good measure, it was constructed in perfect alignment with the tomb of St. Vitus and the setting sun on the equinox.</p>
           <p id="about-attractions">The bridge is particularly famous for its many fine old statues. Among the most important are those of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV and John of Nepomuk, the country's most revered saint, unveiled in 1683 (a more recent superstition involves rubbing the plaque at the base of the statue for the granting of a wish). Other highlights include spectacular views over the River Vltava and the structure's superb Gothic gates. Viewing Charles Bridge at night is also highly recommended (an added benefit are the smaller crowds, particularly after the spectacular sunset).</p>
           <li><strong class="prague">Wenceslas Square</strong></li>
           <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Praha_V%C3%A1noce_2018_6.jpg" alt="The Wenceslas Square" width="400">
           <p id="about-attractions">A highlight of Prague's New Town (Nové Mesto) district—an area that grew out of the city's need to expand as it prospered—is the wonderful Wenceslas Square (Václavské námestí), home to the <strong>National Museum </strong>and numerous other architectural treasures. Named after the patron saint of Bohemia, whose statue can be seen here, Wenceslas Square was created in the 14th century during the reign of Charles IV as a horse market and has since become one of the city's most important public spaces, still used for demonstrations and celebrations alike.</p>
           <p id="about-attractions">
               A visit today is a fun experience and undoubtedly one of the top free things to do in Prague, and will introduce visitors to some of the city's best dining and restaurant experiences, as well as great shopping. If you are visiting Prague in December, it's also the site of the city's largest Christmas Market.</p>
               <li><strong class="prague">The Old Town Square and the Astronomical Clock</strong></li>
               <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/PragueTownHallClock.jpg" alt="The Astronomical Clock" width="400">
              <p id="about-attractions"> The historic center of Prague, the Old Town (Staré Mesto) is where you'll find the splendid Old Town Square (Staromestské námestí), one of the best places to begin exploring the city. Here, you'll find the <strong>Tyn Church </strong>and the <strong>Clementinum</strong>, along with numerous other fine old churches, as well as splendid old architecture dating back as far as the 11th century, while the <strong>Jewish Quarter, Josefov</strong>, is just a short walk north.
           </p>
           <p id="about-attractions">A highlight is the Old Town Hall (Staromestská radnice), home to the wonderful early 15th-century Astronomical Clock (orloj). Each hour, it springs to life as the 12 Apostles and other figures appear and parade in procession across the clock face. Other Old Town Hall highlights are the Gothic doorway leading to its splendid interior with its art exhibits and displays, a chapel built in 1381, and an old prison. Be sure to make the ascent (by stairs or elevator) to the top of the Old Town Hall Tower for its fine views over Prague.</p>
           <li><strong class="prague">The Petrín Lookout Tower</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Pet%C5%99%C3%ADn_Lookout_Tower_at_night.jpg" alt="The Patrin Tower" width="400">
           <p id="about-attractions">Named after the hill on which it stands, the 63.5-meter-high Petrín Lookout Tower (Petrínská rozhledna) is a little like a smaller version of the Eiffel Tower in Paris that offers panoramic views over Prague. Although only a fifth the size of its French counterpart, the tower's elevation creates the illusion that it's bigger than it actually is.</p>
           <p id="about-attractions">Built in 1891 for the Prague Exhibition from disused railway tracks, it was later moved to Petrín Hill in the 1930s, where it became one of the city's major tourist attractions. Today, visitors can either make the 30-minute climb up the Petrín hill to the base of the tower or take a leisurely trip aboard the funicular railway before tackling the structure's 299 steps to the top (there's also an elevator, as well as a café). Be sure to visit the nearby <strong>Mirror Maze</strong>, a fun diversion also built in 1891.</p>
           <li><strong class="prague">The Dancing House</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Maisonkidance.jpg" alt="The Dancing House" width="400">
           <p id="about-attractions">The Dancing House (Tancící dum), Prague's most outstanding modern architectural creation, was built between 1992 and 1996 to designs by Frank Gehry. Consisting of two adjoining towers, this splendid structure features unique curves that resemble two dancing figures, an effect heightened by the fact one of the towers is shaped like a woman wearing a skirt (hence the nickname <em>"Fred and Ginger"</em> after famous American dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers).</p>
           <p id="about-attractions">While the building consists largely of offices and a hotel, great views can be enjoyed from the top floor restaurant (a café is also located on the main level).</p>
